\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
% Begin Section

This document is called the High-Level Architectural Design document and it will be giving the stakeholders a broad overview of how the project 21 Questions is designed and will be organized. 

\subsection{Purpose}
\label{sub:purpose}
% Begin SubSection
The High-Level Architectural Design document outlines the functionality of the system through Use Case diagrams, and details the key classes of the system and how they relate via the use of an Analysis Class Diagram. The main purpose of this document is to explain in detail the software system to be developed, which in this case is the application, 21 Questions. Through the use of the various diagrams mentioned before, the main components of the product and their relationships with each other are shown. The main target audience for this document is the software developers as they need to see, in greater detail, how the system and its modules interact and how they are designed to work in relation to each other.
% End SubSection

\subsection{System Description}
\label{sub:system_description}
% Begin SubSection
21 Questions is an android application that can be used as a location identifier whose intended use is for any user above the age of ten. The application requires minimal training, experience or technical expertise to use, and can be easily picked up and used by anyone. 21 Questions is a simple games that asks the user a series of twenty-one polar or binary questions to try to identify their area of interest. In this game the area of interest is limited to an establishment, building, place, or effigy with a focus on locations only with an end goal of displaying the result through Google Maps.
% End SubSection

\subsection{Overview}
\label{sub:overview}
% Begin SubSection
This document will outline the design of the \textit{21 Questions} application from an architectural perspective. The document will begin from a use case outlook, outlining application functionality from a practical point of view and taking different actors and stakeholders into consideration. Next, an analysis class diagram and associated interpretation details is outlined, to specify application behaviours and resources in a modularized form. Following this section is a detailed architectural design as well as a set of class responsibility collaboration cards. These sections specify modules in greater detail, including interfaces to be implemented in the future. The order of these sections reflects a systematic progression from requirements to a more easily constructed application.

\section{Architectural Design}
\label{sec:architectural_design}
% Begin Section
The desired system architecture for solving this issue is the blackboard architecture because of experts are able to identify different aspects of the area of interest, these module can be swapped out if needed to give a more accurate result. Each expert will be there own ADT on the front end of the application so that it will be easy to provide an interface for experts so that we increase the modularity of the design. Each expert will be able to communicate to there own database, the database is essential to ensure that multiple clients will have access to the same information without having to preform updates.

\subsection{System Architecture}

Figure \ref{diagram:analysisclass} contains the analysis class diagram. The diagram is designed so that way each entity or boundary class will communication there controller and the controllers will communication between each other.The design is set up into three separate units of: interface, logic and data. The system design is a black board model with a data store, with the experts all using the same interface so that they can properly communicate to the question controller class. The system will have two controllers, one for handling the pages of the system and the other for controlling which expert can ask questions. Each expert will create a guess of what they might think is the item in which the user is thinking of. The controller will ask one expert at a time to provide a question to ask the user, based on the users response will either prove that is not the thing we are looking for or that it still might be. The experts will then provide there best guess to the controller, the controller will then compile these answers into a search in which will be displayed on a map for the user. In this way our system will not rely on any one expert, making it easy to add and remove experts in order to provide a better result.

\subsection{Subsystems}
\label{sub:subsystems}
% Begin SubSection
The database controller will deal with different clients asking for unique information. This entitles that it will process any information, run the query that is needed, and send the information that is related to the problem. \\ \\
The next tier to the system is the logical layer. This layer is responsible for the control flow of the game, ensuring that each expert entity will properly get to ask there respective questions. The controller will deal with receiving the information that is passed in from the GUI controller and dealing with incoming information from the Data layer. Using the guesses form each of the experts to create a final solution to the problem.\\ \\
Finally the GUI controller, will with ensuring the proper screen is shown. The controller receive, process and send information from the screens to the question controller. The receive information from the logic controller to use in the questions or map boundary class. The start screen, which will show the initial menu a user will be viewing, this module will take user input to start a game or change the setting of the game. The question controller will display the questions for the user to answer and will pass off this information the the GUI controller. The setting screen will provide a sub-menu which would allow a user to change the functionality of the system in regards to: accessibility, font colors, sizes, and preferences. finally the map screen will be where we provide the user with a map of what the final result is and will take feedback from the user if it is correct or incorrect.

\section*{IMPORTANT NOTES}
\begin{itemize}
%	\item You do \underline{NOT} need to provide a text explanation of each diagram; the diagram should speak for itself
	\item Please document any non-standard notations that you may have used
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \emph{Rule of Thumb}: if you feel there is any doubt surrounding the meaning of your notations, document them
	\end{itemize}
	\item Some diagrams may be difficult to fit into one page
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It is OK if the text is small but please ensure that it is readable when printed
		\item If you need to break a diagram onto multiple pages, please adopt a system of doing so and thoroughly explain how it can be reconnected from one page to the next; if you are unsure about this, please ask about it
	\end{itemize}
	\item Please submit the latest version of Deliverable 1 with Deliverable 2
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It does not have to be a freshly printed version; the latest marked version is OK
