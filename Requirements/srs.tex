		\section{Overall Description}
		\label{sec:overall_description}
		% Begin Section
		
		\subsection{Product Perspective}
		\label{sub:product_perspective}
		% Begin SubSection
			\indent \indent 21 Questions is simple location identification application which asks the user a total of 21 questions to try and identify the \textbf{AOI}. 21 Questions is very similar to other identification applications such as \textit{Akinator} or the game \textit{20Q}. \textit{Akinator} is a web based program where the user thinks of a character and answers a series of questions, leading to the program guessing the character the user has thought of. \textit{20Q} or 20 Questions is the original inspiration for our program, like \textit{Akinator}, the user thinks of something but in this case it can be any person, place or thing. The game would then ask the user a total of 20 questions to try and guess what the user is thinking of. To differentiate our application with \textit{20Q}, 21 Questions focuses on locations only with an end goal of outputting the result through \textit{Google Maps}. Overall, the system is independent and only uses the Google API as its only resource outside of the system.
		% End SubSection
		
		\subsection{Product Functions}
		\label{sub:product_functions}
		% Begin SubSection
		The following is a list of product functions that the software will perform:
		\begin{enumerate}[a)]
			\item The system identifies an AOI using three different experts.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item This is one of the main requirements and functionality of 21 Questions, the system uses three different experts which are independent of each other to reach a resulting output to user inputs.
			\end{itemize}
			\item The system forms a query using the answers inputted by the user and is then outputted through Google Maps.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item From the users' answers to the preset questions, \textbf{queries} are formed and used to find the \textbf{AOI}. A set of queries are stored in a database which is referenced and used along with the Google maps API to display the resulting location on a map.
			\end{itemize}
			\item The system allows for users to add new queries.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item The ability to add new queries for new locations is an important functionality of the application as it allows the database to continuously grow.
			\end{itemize}
			\item The system shall allow for voice commands as a possible input to answer the questions.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item The use of voice commands will be our innovative feature and will allow for a wider range of users to be able to use the app. Adding the use of voice commands as an input improves the applications accessibility and allows for those with visual impairment, such as blind persons to be able to use 21 Questions.
			\end{itemize} 
		\end{enumerate}
		% End SubSection
		
		\subsection{User Characteristics}
		\label{sub:user_characteristics}
		% Begin SubSection
		\begin{enumerate}[a)]
			\item General Characteristics of Intended Users 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item 21 Questions is a location identifier application whose intended use is for any user above the age of ten. The application requires minimal training, experience or technical expertise to use, and can be easily picked up and used by anyone. 21 Questions can be used as a game where users select a location and see if the software can identify it based on the user's answers to a set of predefined questions. The application can also be used to identify a location, structure, or establishment as answering the questions will output the result via Google maps. 
			\end{itemize}
			\item Reasoning for Requirements
			\begin{itemize}
				\item As later stated in the non-functional requirements, any user can easily learn how to use the application. With game like aspects, 21 questions is meant for users of all ages and thus it should be simple enough that users of a younger audience will be able to play while users of an older audience will still find the game appealing.
				\item The application targets a wide variety of users with different ethnic backgrounds and thus must be respectful of everyones cultures, religious belief and political preferences.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{enumerate}
		% End SubSection
		
				
		\subsection{Constraints}
		\label{sub:constraints}
		% Begin SubSection
		The following constraints are to limit the design of the software to be:
		
		\begin{enumerate}[a)]
			\item The system must have three experts modules in which will determine an aspect about the location to identify.
			\item The systems software experts are not able to communicate between each other.
			\item The system should use the Google Maps API.
			\item The should must be designed so that one could swap out any expert for another.
			\item The system must have access to the Internet.
			\item The system must encrypt all transmitted messages.
			\item The system must abide to all the Canadian laws.
			\item The system must abide to all terms and conditions set by the Google Maps API.
			
		\end{enumerate}
		% End SubSection
		
		\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
		\label{sub:assumptions_and_dependencies}
		% Begin SubSection
		\begin{enumerate}[a)]
			\item Assumptions
			\begin{itemize}
				\item The system can only find locations within the set domain.
				\item The user will only use the system to identify real locations.
				
			\end{itemize}
			\item Dependencies
			
			\begin{itemize}
				\item The system is dependent on the functionality the Google Maps API.
				\item The system's performance is dependent on the speed and quality of the user's Internet.
				\item The system's performance is dependent on the operating systems overhead.
				
			\end{itemize}
		\end{enumerate}
		% End SubSection
		
		\subsection{Apportioning of Requirements}
		\label{sub:apportioning_of_requirements}
		% Begin SubSection
		\begin{enumerate}[a)]
			\item Letting the user add locations to the existing set of locations.
			\item Using social media to allow the user to share the location that the system predicted.
			\item Suggest locations based off of interest and large news stories through social media.

		\section*{IMPORTANT NOTES}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Be sure to include all sections of the template in your document regardless whether you have something to write for each or not
			\begin{itemize}
				\item If you do not have anything to write in a section, indicate this by the \emph{N/A}, \emph{void}, \emph{none}, etc.
			\end{itemize}
			\item Uniquely number each of your requirements for easy identification and cross-referencing
			\item Highlight terms that are defined in Section~1.3 (\textbf{Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations}) with \textbf{bold}, \emph{italic} or \underline{underline}
			\item For Deliverable 1, please highlight, in some fashion, all (you may have more than one) creative and innovative features. Your creative and innovative features will generally be described in Section~2.2 (\textbf{Product Functions}), but it will depend on the type of creative or innovative features you are including.
